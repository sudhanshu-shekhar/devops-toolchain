_Be sure to join the [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/devops-toolchain) for project updates_

This project is a collaborative effort to discuss methodology and successful tool chains that support development and operations life cycle activities.

**Note, this is not a formal standards effort, nor is it an effort to establish a single one size fits all tool chain!** Hearing about current approaches and solutions is just as valuable.

A [tool chain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toolchain) philosophy espouses that a set of complimentary task specific tools are used in combination to automate an end to end process. The concept and tradition of DevOps is not new but has begun to crystalize as a term to represent using certain best practices that unify work done by development and operations early and often, throughout the software life cycle.

Anyone interested in sharing or gaining knowledge is strongly encouraged to join in and become part of this community. We intend it a place where end users will drive the discussion and thinking.

Some of the specific goals of this project are to:
  * Mailing list to discuss approaches, anecdotes and applications of approaches and tools: [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/devops-toolchain)
  * Document methodologies and best practices: [BestPractices](BestPractices.md)
  * Define architectural vision of the tool chain(s) with an eye towards phased evolution: [ArchitectureComponents](ArchitectureComponents.md)


Benefits of a toolchain...
  * Helps figure out how tools fit together
  * Stop the constant reinvention of the the wheel
  * Consolidate terminology
  * Help toolsmiths align efforts
