While DevOps is a broad term, one can say there certainly are best practices that underly it. Applying any one of these best practices should result in an improvement to the life cycle or operation of a service. Taken together, these best practices can form a DevOps methodology.

To help apply the best practice, it is important to relate it to the associated [Tooling](Tooling.md), [SdlcPhases](SdlcPhases.md), as well as gauge it's [Qualities](Qualities.md). Some should correspond to documented [design patterns](PatternRepository.md).

Below is just a draft list of example best practices.  Each of these should be expanded in their own page.

  * Collaboration and involvement early in the life cycle

  * Configuration is code and separated from app code as artifact

  * Operational concerns as non-func throughout the life cycle

  * Consistent tooling between the dev ops teams

  * Using packaging as release vehicle

  * Abstracted administration

  * Automated build and release

  * Modeled life cycles that drive tool behavior (eg versioned SDLCs)

  * Automated infrastructure/system provisioning

  * Audited release tracing  (requirements to operation)

  * Ops tooling falls under the same SDLC as the bizapp

  * Scripted database changes released as an artifact

  * Automation code is code and therefore governed by its own SDLC and released like software
